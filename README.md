#The Influence of Arousal on Brain Connectivity: A Multimodal Study Proposal

Arousal, defined as the behavioral state of alertness, is a potential driver of variability in brain activity and functional connectivity, particularly within networks such as the Default Mode Network and the Salience Network. In this project, we aim to investigate the effects of arousal on brain connectivity using a recently published open-access dataset that integrates pre-processed pupillometry, fMRI, and EEG data, enabling a comprehensive multimodal analysis. By combining pupillometry (as a proxy to identify high and low arousal levels), EEG (offering high temporal resolution of brain activity), and fMRI (providing high spatial resolution of functional activity), we can investigate the relationships between arousal states and both functional and effective connectivity across key brain regions.

##Goals for the BrainHack:

Identify arousal-related brain regions through the analysis of the relationships between pupil dynamics and fMRI signals at both voxel and region levels (e.g., via correlation or regression analyses on resting-state data)
Compare functional and effective connectivity within arousal-related networks across high and low arousal states, using indices derived from both fMRI and EEG resting-state connectivity
As a secondary objective, we aim to replicate these analyses on a visual task dataset to compare the impact of arousal under resting-state and task-based conditions.
